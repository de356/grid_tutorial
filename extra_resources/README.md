# Extra Resources
This folder contains package documentation for all those packages used that don't come included with R.  
`grid` comes built into R, and doesn't need to be downloaded. It also lacks any official documentation notes on CRAN. Although additional information on the package can be found at the following link:  
[https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grid/versions/3.6.2](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grid/versions/3.6.2)  
`tidyverse` is actually composed of several different packages, and also lacks any single official documentation source. More information on the package can be found at the following link:

[`gridExtra`](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-de356/blob/master/extra_resources/gridExtra_documentation.pdf) - *Provides a number of user-level functions to work with "grid" graphics, notably to arrange multiple grid-based plots on a page, and draw tables.*  
[`gridtext`](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-de356/blob/master/extra_resources/gridtext_documentation.pdf) - *Provides support for rendering of formatted text using 'grid' graphics. Text can be formatted via a minimal subset of 'Markdown', 'HTML', and inline 'CSS' directives, and it can be rendered both with and without word wrap.*  
[`imager`](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-de356/blob/master/extra_resources/imager_documentation.pdf) - *Fast image processing for images in up to 4 dimensions (two spatialdimensions, one time/depth dimension, one colour dimension). Provides most traditional image processing tools (filtering, morphology, transformations, etc.) as well as various functions for easily analysing image data using R*
